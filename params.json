{"name":"Elementaljs","body":"# Getting Started\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nCurrenty, elemental.js depends on jQuery and UnderscoreJS, we'll try and refactor these out, but in this early stage you'll need those too. Sorry.\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nDrop the elemental.js file into your project and load the container you want to apply this library too. In most cases you'll want to apply to the whole document.\r\n\r\n\tElemental.load(document);\r\n\t\r\nThen in any HTML, you can add a behaviour through a data attribute.\r\n\r\n\t<div data-behaviour=\"MybehaviourFunction\"></div>\r\n\t\r\nAfter load, ElementalJS will look for any elements with the data-behaviour attribute and run the function named.  It will pass the containing element through to the behaviour so that the function can apply behaviours directly to that element and it's children.\r\n\r\n\tMyBehaviour = function(element) {\r\n\t\talert(element);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\nThe behaviour names can be namespaced so you can have HTML that looks like:\r\n\r\n\t<div data-behaviour=\"My.App.Behave\"></div>\r\n\r\nIt is possible to either use fully qualified function names, or you can tell Elemental about a namespace where the function lives.\r\n\r\n\tMy = { \r\n\t\tApp: {\r\n\t\t\tBehave: function(element){\r\n\t\t\t\talert(element);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t} \r\n\t};\r\n\t\r\n\tElemental.addNamespace(My.App);\r\n\tElemental.load(document);\r\n\t\r\nThen in your HTML, you can put the function name without the namespace.\r\n\r\n\t<div data-behaviour=\"Behave\"></div>\r\n\t\r\n# Available Behaviours\r\n\r\n## Javascript enabled\r\n\r\nThis behaviour adds a class of 'js' to the element it's included on. This is useful for stylesheets to target environments knowing that Javascript is enabled or not. For maximum benefit, include this behaviour on the body element.\r\n\r\n- Include the file in src/behaviors/javascript_enabled.js\r\n- Add 'Elemental.JavascriptEnabled' to the body element\r\n\r\n# Development\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nYou'll need bundler to install the Rubygem dependencies for the build process.\r\n\r\n\tgem install bundler\r\n\tbundle install --binstubs\r\n\t\r\nWhen you're developing, run the following command to use binaries in the bin folder that bundler has installed there. \r\n\r\n\texport PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n### Jasmine\r\n\r\nTo get Jasmine up and running, run the following rake task\r\n\r\n\trake jasmine\r\n\t\r\nThen point your browser to http://localhost:8888\t\r\n\r\n### Continuous Integration\r\n\r\nA rake task called 'ci' will run JSLint and Jasmine tests.\r\n\r\n\trake ci\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\nFork this project and create a new branch. Make the code changes including tests and then send a pull request.\r\n\r\n# Next Steps\r\n\r\nWe will look to add common behaviours and refactor out the dependencies on jQuery and Underscore. We think it'd be better to create a separate project for common behaviours using different libraries, i.e. elemental-jquery. ","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
